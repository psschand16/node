# Site Assist DevOps Test

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to do our technical test. There are no trick questions here, we are just looking for you to do what you do best and provide us an example of your work in a simplified context.

To submit your tech test please send a tarball of your solution via email. Please do not upload it to the internet.

Please use git while you work and submit the .git folder as part of your submission.

## Technical Test
Here we have a basic hello-world style node server. 

The exercise is to deploy it to the cloud as you would any production service, explaining any and all decisions that are made along the way.

You should use *Terraform* to deploy the server.

### Requirements
- Deploy the node server to AWS
- Make it Production ready 

## Deliverables
As part of you submission please include a Markdown file that answers the following questions:

1. Describe why you made the choices that you did. What would you do differently?
2. How long did you spend on the coding test? Why that length of time?
